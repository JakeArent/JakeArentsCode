Code for projects that I have worked on for classes at Florida Polytechnic.

All assets used in the creation of these games were found for free on the Unity Asset Store.

The first project, Quickdraw, is a western themed First Person Shooter with a twist. The player character feels the need to always spin their gun. When the player shoots, the bullet will travel forwards from wherever the gun is currently pointing. There are 4 levels created for this game.
The first level is a quick tutorial, where you have to shoot a few bottles on a counter, and then are ambushed by two bandits.
On the second level, you have to rescue the mayor from the bandits, but the stairs are blocked by debris. There is dynamite hidden around the first floor to clear the stairway.
The third level has you clear the town of any remaining bandits, introducing a new enemy that can shoot back.
The final level has you go to the bandits camp to clear them out once and for all.

Most of these levels were designed to test out the gun spinning mechanic in different environments, and while it was an interesting phyiscal timing challenge, it did not work well in every environment. Notably, on the third level it is more difficult than intended to shoot the snipers on an elevated position.
